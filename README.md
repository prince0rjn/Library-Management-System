Library Management System

This is a simple Library Management System project created as part of my first college project. I worked on this project with the help of a project guide and one other team member. The system has basic functionality for managing library resources and patrons.

Features

The Library Management System includes the following features:

Login system for librarians and patrons
Librarian functions for adding, editing, and deleting books and patrons
Patron functions for searching for books and placing holds on checked-out books
Book checkout and return functions

Installation

To use the Library Management System, you will need to have a web server with PHP and MySQL installed. You can then download or clone the repository to your server and set up a new MySQL database for the system.

To set up the database, you can import the library.sql file included in the repository. You will also need to update the config.php file with your database connection details.

Usage

To use the Library Management System, you can navigate to the index.php file in your web browser. From there, you can log in as a librarian or a patron and access the different functions of the system.
